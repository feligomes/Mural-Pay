## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mural-pay
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add required environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url_here
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Important Notes

1. **Colombian Address Format**:
   - The API requires a secondary address line

2. **Phone Number Format**:
   - Colombian phone numbers are required for all requests

3. **Transfer Request Filtering**:
   - Transfer request filtering is currently implemented client-side because the API does not support filtering by account

4. **Transfer Request Display**:
   - The transfer requests table displays a "From" field showing the account name
   - The "To" field is currently unavailable as this information is not provided by the API endpoint. This may be added in future updates to improve transfer request clarity.

5. **Account Management**:
   - The API does not support account deletion
   - To manage dashboard clutter, accounts are displayed using a "Show More" pagination system
   - Accounts are sorted by last update date, with most recent updates appearing first

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced API Integration**:
   - Include recipient information in transfer request listings
   - Expand transaction details in API responses

2. **User Experience**:
   - Implement bulk transfer request operations
   - Add real-time status updates using WebSocket
   - Enhance transaction history visualization
   - Add export functionality for transfer requests
   - Enable detailed view of transfer requests

3. **Internationalization**:
   - Support for multiple countries beyond Colombia
   - Multi-language support
   - Dynamic currency conversion

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Scheduled transfers
   - Recurring transfer requests
   - Transfer request templates
   - Advanced analytics and reporting
