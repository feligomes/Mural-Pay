## Important Notes

1. **Colombian Address Handling**:
   - The API requieres a second address for Colombian addresses

2. **Phone Number Format**:
   - A Colombian phone numbers must be used for the requests

3. **Transfer Request Filtering**:
   - Currently, transfer request filtering is implemented on the frontend
   - This is due to API limitations in the provided endpoints, filtering by account is not available

4. **Transfer Request Display**:
   - The transfer requests table shows the "From" field
   - "To" field information is not available in the list endpoint response
   - If the API ends up providing more info we could make more descriptive rows

5. **Account Deletion**:
   - The API doesnt allow to delete accounts, for these reason when testing the dashboard may get over populated with accounts. 
   - To prevent this I implement a show more concept for the cards in the dashboard and ordering them with the last updated at the top. 

## Possible future Improvements

1. **Enhanced API Integration**:
   - Integration with recipient information in transfer request listings
   - Expanded transaction details in API responses

2. **User Experience**:
   - Add bulk transfer request operations
   - Implement real-time status updates using WebSocket
   - Enhanced transaction history visualization
   - Export functionality for transfer requests
   - Posibility to see the details of a transfer request

3. **Internationalization**:
   - Support for multiple countries beyond Colombia
   - Multi-language support
   - Dynamic currency conversion

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Scheduled transfers
   - Recurring transfer requests
   - Transfer request templates
   - Advanced analytics and reporting
